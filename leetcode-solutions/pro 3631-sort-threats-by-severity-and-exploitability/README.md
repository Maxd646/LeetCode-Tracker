# Leetcode pro 3631 -  Sort Threats by Severity and Exploitability

[🔗 Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-threats-by-severity-and-exploitability/)

## Description

 
You are given a 2D integer array threats, where each threats[i] = [IDi, sevi​, expi]

IDi: Unique identifier of the threat.
sevi: Indicates the severity of the threat.
expi: Indicates the exploitability of the threat.
The score of a threat i is defined as: score = 2 × sevi + expi

Your task is to return threats sorted in descending order of score.


If multiple threats have the same score, sort them by ascending ID​​​​​​​.

 

Example 1:

Input: threats = [[101,2,3],[102,3,2],[103,3,3]]

Output: [[103,3,3],[102,3,2],[101,2,3]]

Explanation:

Threat	ID	sev	exp	Score = 2 × sev + exp
threats[0]	101	2	3	2 × 2 + 3 = 7
threats[1]	102	3	2	2 × 3 + 2 = 8
threats[2]	103	3	3	2 × 3 + 3 = 9
Sorted Order: [[103, 3, 3], [102, 3, 2], [101, 2, 3]]

Example 2:

Input: threats = [[101,4,1],[103,1,5],[102,1,5]]

Output: [[101,4,1],[102,1,5],[103,1,5]]

Explanation:​​​​​​​

Threat	ID	sev	exp	Score = 2 × sev + exp
threats[0]	101	4	1	2 × 4 + 1 = 9
threats[1]	103	1	5	2 × 1 + 5 = 7
threats[2]	102	1	5	2 × 1 + 5 = 7
threats[1] and threats[2] have same score, thus sort them by ascending ID.

Sorted Order: [[101, 4, 1], [102, 1, 5], [103, 1, 5]]

 


Constraints:

1 <= threats.length <= 105
threats[i] == [IDi, sevi, expi]
1 <= IDi <= 106
1 <= sevi <= 109
1 <= expi <= 109
All IDi are unique
