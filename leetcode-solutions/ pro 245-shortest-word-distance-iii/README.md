## LeetCode 245. Shortest Word Distance III

Given an array of strings wordsDict and two strings word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Note:
word1 and word2 may be the same word. In that case, you must find the shortest distance between two different occurrences of the same word.

Example 1:

Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"],
word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: wordsDict = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"],
word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"
Output: 3

Constraints:

1 ‚â§ wordsDict.length ‚â§ 10‚Å¥
1 ‚â§ wordsDict[i].length ‚â§ 10
wordsDict[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
word1 and word2 are in wordsDict.
