# Leetcode pro 1085 - Sum of Digits in the Minimum Number

[🔗 Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-in-the-minimum-number/)

## Description

Description
Given an integer array nums, return 0 if the sum of the digits of the minimum integer in nums is odd, or 1 otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8]
Output: 0
Explanation: The minimal element is 1, and the sum of those digits is 1 which is odd, so the answer is 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [99,77,33,66,55]
Output: 1
Explanation: The minimal element is 33, and the sum of those digits is 3 + 3 = 6 which is even, so the answer is 1.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
